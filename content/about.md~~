Hi! I am abhinash Khare. I work as a senior MLE in the Ads relevance and ranking team at sharechat, where I am working on solving the calibration problem of core ML models. I finished my master's in Computer Science (ML) from IISc Bengaluru (2018) and I have been working in the industry as an Applied researcher in various domains, such as NLP for Financial document analysis, Conversational AI and recently, Ads recommendations.


Outside of my work, you can find me implementing complicated cooking recipes. I believe cooking is like a chemistry experiment. You have to play with various ingredients till you find the perfect combination. I often take my motorbike on long distance tours (My best is 660KM in a single day) and a trip that I did in the summer of 2022 -- Manali to Atal tunnel tops the list of my favourite rides. In the morning, you can find me working out in the gym or finishing the 7k run. I am trying to learn guitar and some salsa moves, so please hit me up with tips and tricks.
